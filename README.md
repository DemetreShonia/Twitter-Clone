## üì∑ Sneaky Pics
Thanks a lot  [@RivaanRanawat](https://www.youtube.com/@RivaanRanawat) on YT for this amazing opportunity. This project was challenging and complex, packed with many features. However, I learned a great deal, particularly about clean architecture using Riverpod in Flutter!

## üìù Clean Code Tips
I‚Äôve written a 10-page guide on clean code architecture tips for Flutter, which you can view here: [Flutter Clean Architecture Tips.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17265850/Flutter.Clean.Architecture.Tips.pdf); It covers topics like UI/Controller/API, as well as MVC and MVVM architectures. **Note:** it is unfortunatelly in georgian language and might not be useful for everyone but there is a lot to learn from it!
